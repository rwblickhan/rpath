# ðŸ”¦ rpath

This is a relatively simple (~400 line) path tracer,
heavily inspired by KÃ¡roly Zsolnai-FehÃ©r's
[Smallpaint](https://users.cg.tuwien.ac.at/zsolnai/gfx/smallpaint/),
featuring (at the moment) diffuse, specular, and refractive
(glass) materials, sphere and plane geometry, and
Russian roulette stopping.
